t5 is a high-performance library for developing web applications where 
performance and speed is mission critical.

t5 uses a pure event driven architecture, running in an event loop for
250ms before exiting, regardless of what has or hasn't happened.

t5 has a single entry and exit point, and uses only a single function for
it's entire API.

t5 is meant to be used for small to large size websites that demand a lighting
fast application which uses very little memory and is highly extensible and
completely decoupled.
